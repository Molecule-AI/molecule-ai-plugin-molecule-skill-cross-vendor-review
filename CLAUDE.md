# molecule-skill-cross-vendor-review — Adversarial Multi-Model Code Review

`molecule-skill-cross-vendor-review` runs an adversarial code review against
a non-Claude model (Codex / GPT / Gemini) and surfaces disagreements with
Claude's own review. Use **only for noteworthy PRs**: auth, billing, data-deletion,
irreversible migration.

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Runtime:** `claude_code`

## When to Use

✅ Use for PRs involving:
- Authentication or authorisation changes
- Billing or payment logic
- Data deletion or irreversible migrations
- Large blast-radius refactors

❌ Do NOT use for:
- Documentation-only PRs
- Minor typo fixes
- Mechanical formatting changes

## How It Works

1. Claude Code reviews the PR (internal review)
2. A non-Claude model (GPT-4 / Codex / Gemini) reviews the same PR
3. The skill surfaces points of disagreement:
   - Something Claude flagged but the other model missed
   - Something the other model flagged but Claude missed
4. The agent synthesises a final recommendation

### Required API Keys

The non-Claude model is called via its API. Set the key as a workspace secret:

```bash
# GPT-4
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # set via workspace secret

# Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...     # set via workspace secret

# Codex
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Codex uses the same key
```

cd molecule-ai-plugin-molecule-skill-cross-vendor-review
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('plugin.yaml'))"
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('plugin.yaml'))"

python3 -c "
import re, sys
with open('plugin.yaml') as f:
    content = f.read()
patterns = [r'sk.ant', r'ghp.', r'AKIA[A-Z0-9]']
if any(re.search(p, content) for p in patterns):
    print('FAIL: possible credentials found')
    sys.exit(1)
print('No credentials: OK')
"
```
